## Projects
### Customer Churn Prediction
- Developed a customer churn prediction model using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, involving data preprocessing, visualization, model  training with RandomForestClassifier, and saving the model for future use. 

 ### RNN Model Experiment
 - Conducted experiments with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence tasks, including sentiment analysis, by implementing basic
 RNNs, stacking RNN layers and bi-directional RNNs, and exploring hybrid RNN-CNN architectures to enhance model performance.

### Fault Detection of Induction Motor using Machine Learning
-Developed a machine learning system for detecting faults in induction motors by analyzing sensor data to identify anomalies and predict issues like broken rotors, bearing faults, and winding faults.

### Face and Eye Detection System Using Computer Vision
- Built a Python-based facial detection engine using pre-trained Haar classifiers with OpenCV, featuring a GUI created in Tkinter for real-time face and eye detection.

### Water Level Controller via Gate level implementation
- Designed and implemented a water level controller and indicator using a 5V DC pump, sensors, 7-segment displays, and memory storage to monitor filling times and manage alerts for tank overflow.

### Traffic Flow and Accident Prediction System
 - Implementation of LSTM and CNN for prediction of real-time traffic flow and accident prediction and alert system and development via web development  

### PID Temperature Control for Indoor Farming
- Real-time temperature control via PID controller and implementation in real-life scenarios i.e. green houses and nurseries. 

### Weather app and Implementation via Kubernetes and Docker
- The weather app uses Python and Flask to retrieve data from the OpenWeather API for a web interface. It is containerized with Docker, deployed as a pod on Kubernetes (Minikube), and accessible through a service on the host machine, with monitoring done via the Minikube dashboard.
